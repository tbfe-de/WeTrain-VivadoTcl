the option to open this file in an editor and take notes.

header: ## Part 1: Analyze the Example

Get familiar with the Tcl script `Examples/flow_demo.tcl` and answer the
following questions:

* What is obviousyl the purpose of its first (ca.) 10 lines?

* Which Tcl sub-routines are defined?

* Which "test cases" are contained.

* How can these be executed?

.F[:
Hint (if you need one):
The script file are written to be run "stand-alone", i.e. from a plain Tcl
interpreter as available on Linux and Windows (e.g. via Active Tcl in the
latter case). Nevertheless it is also possible to `source` them from the Vivado
Tcl Shell **after** setting the variable `argv` to select one of the prepared
test cases:
```
set argv hard-coded_1
source -notrace Examples/flow_demo.tcl
```
Or:
```
set argv orthogonal
source -notrace Examples/flow_demo.tcl
```
(etc.)
]

header: ### Part 2 / Step 1: Compare `hard-coded` to `fixed_args`

Try the following test cases contained in `Examples/flow_demo.tcl`:

* `hard-coded_1` and `hard-coded_2`

* `fixed-args_1` and `fixed-args_2`

Are there any differences in the output?._[]

.N[
Be sure to understand how the `parametrized_flow` factors-out commonalities in
the two (previously) hard-coded flows and handles variations via arguments.
]

.F[:
Of course there shouldn't be any …

template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Step 2: Understand Orthogonal Variations

How many executions of the `parametrized_flow` do you expect with the current
argument set for "orthogonal" variations:
```
set argset_1 [list fff ggg iii]
set argset_2 [list uuu vvv www xxx yyy]
```

.pull-left[
How many do you expect here …
```
set argset_1 [list fff ggg iii]
set argset_2 [list uuu yyy]
```
]
.pull-right[
… and here?
```
set argset_1 [list fff "ii oo"]
set argset_2 [list uuu xxx yyy]
```
]

(Of course, you should also verify your prediction and – if there was a
difference – understand why your guess was wrong.)

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Step 3: Understand Tree-Based Variations

How many executions of the `parametrized_flow` do you expect with the current
argument set for "tree-based" variations:
```
set argset_tree {
    fff { uuu vvv www         }
    ggg { uuu         xxx     }
    iii {         www xxx yyy }
}
```

How many do you expect here?
```
set argset_tree { fff { uuu www } ggg { uuu xxx } iii www }
```

header: ## Intermezzo:

Assuming you have grasped the idea to run a design flow with systematic variations
via control loops …

… feel free to apply the technique now to a small demo project.

header: ## Optional Part 3: More Flow Variations

The reminder of this Lab deals with

* some ideas to add more "flow variations" and

* "user-friendly" ways to control these via variables only.._[]

.F[:
The results of this part "just scratches the surface" and might – for advanced
applications – evolve into a *"Domain Specific 'little' Language"*, specifying
optimization strategies where consecutive refinements (i.e.  steps applied and
options tried second, third, forth etc.) depend on previous results.

template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 1: Conditional Flow Parts

Add a third argument to the `parametrized_flow` which may take the value `1` or
`0` and completely omits the `aaa ddd zzz` in the second case.

.pull-left[
Which arguments need now be given to get this …
```
aaa ddd vvv ttt
aaa ppp jjj
qqq zzz vvv ppp
```
]
.pull-right[
… and this result?
```
aaa ddd uuu ttt
aaa ddd zzz
aaa ppp jjj
qqq zzz uuu ppp
```
]

.F[:
Hint (if you need one):  
If your third argument is named `arg3`, enclose any conditional part (…) that
way: `if {$arg3} { … }`
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 2: Adding Orthogonal Levels

Modify the "orthogonal variations" by adding add a third level

* so that the conditional part – according to the modification done in the
  previous step

  * gets **systematically added and omitted**,

  * for **all variations** controlled by `argset_1` and `argset_2`

.F[:
Hint (if you need one):  
You may either use a conditional in the current two (nested) `foreach`-loops or
– probably better as then all behaviour were "controlled by data" – add an `argset_3`
with values `0` and `1` and a third (nested) `foreach`-loop.
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 3: Adding Tree-Based Levels

Modify "tree-based variations" so that – with respect to the conditional part
introduced in Step 1 – the control specification
```
set argset_tree {
    fff { uuu vvv www         } yes
    ggg { uuu         xxx     } no
    iii {         www xxx yyy } yesno
}
```
will cause the following **eleven** runs of `parametrized_flow`:

* for `arg1` taking the value `fff` **three** runs total with
  * `arg2` taking the values `uuu`, `vvv`, `www`, and
  * the conditional part *always included*;
* for `arg1` taking the value `ggg` **two** runs total with
  * `arg2` taking the values `uuu` and `xxx`, and
  * the conditional part *never included*;
* for `arg1` taking the value `iii` **six** runs total with
  * `arg2` taking the values `www`, `xxx`, and `yyy`, and
  * the conditional part *included once* and *omitted once*.

.F[:
Hint (if you need one): There are "*many ways to skin the cat*" but a
particularly nifty approach would be to map "`yes`", "`no`", and "`yesno`" to 
the lists `{1}`, `{0}`, and `{1 0}` and just add another `foreach`-loop …
