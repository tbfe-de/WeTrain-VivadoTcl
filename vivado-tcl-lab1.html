template:plain
header: ## Part 1: Using Vivado as Tcl-Shell

.N.center[
**All parts of this Lab** are *Pure Tcl* – nothing is Vivado specific.
]

Nevertheless sse Vivado as Tcl-Shell in one of the following ways:

* Start *Vivado in GUI Mode* and use the *Tcl Console* to:
  * Enter Tcl commands in its *Command line*
  * View the result in its *Output Window*

* **Or:** Start Vivado in GUI mode, then:
  * Enter `stop_gui` at the *Tcl Console Command Line*
  * Continue to work in with *Vivado in Tcl Mode*
  * (How would you terminate your Tcl session then?)

* **Or:** Directly start *Vivado in Tcl Mode*:
  * (When done with everything, enter `exit` as command.)

template: plain
header: ## Part 2: Some Simple Tcl Commands

.N.center[
Directly type-in the commands (as interactive input).
]

.pull-left[
Print a greet:
```
puts "hello, world"
```

As before, but in two lines:
```
puts "hello\nworld"
```

Just a comment:
```
# just a comment
```

Show Tcl version:
```
puts $tcl_version
```
]
.pull-right[
Value of PI:
```
expr 2*acos(0.0)
```

Files in working dirctory:
```
glob *
```

Current time:
```
clock seconds
```

Explain this:
```
set tcl_version
```
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 2: Using Tcl Variables

.N[
Note that once set, a variable keeps its value until it is `unset`.
]

.pull-left[
```
set greet "hello, world"
puts $greet
```

Playing games with `expr`:
```
set PI_half acos(0.0)
puts $PI_half
expr $PI_half
expr 2*$PI_half
set PI 2*$PI_half
expr $PI
puts $PI
```

Environment Variables:
```
puts $env(PATH)
puts $env(HOME)
```
]
.pull-right[
Predefined Variables:
```
array get env
info vars
info vars tcl_* 
array get tcl_platform
info vars a*
```
Looking around in the file system:
```
pwd
cd ..
pwd
glob *
glob * -type directory
file stat $env(HOME) attrs
array get attrs
info vars a*
```
]

template: plain
header: ## Part 3: Tcl Command Return Values

.pull-left[
First, understand this!._[]
```
expr 1+1
puts [expr 1+1]
expr 6*7
puts [expr 6*7]
expr 1+1;expr 6*7
puts [expr 1+1];puts [expr 6*7]
```

PI again:
```
# same, same, but different
set PI_half [expr acos(0.0)]
set PI [expr 2*$PI]
puts $PI_half; puts $PI
```
]
.pull-right[
And still counting …
```
# the hard way
set x 1; puts $x
set x [expr $x+1]; puts $x

# and the easy one
puts [set x 42]
puts [incr x]
puts [incr x -10]
```

(No) More Time:
```
set now [clock seconds]
format [clock format $now]
```
]

.F[:
When interactively working with a Tcl Shell – as a service – the **return
value of the last command** is displayed. In you put two or more commands in
one line (separated with a semicolon) you will only see the return value of
the **last** command.  
The situation changes when `puts` **generates explicit output**.
Then – of course – nothing will be silently swept under the carpet if there
are several `puts` commands in one line.
]

template: plain
header: ## Part 4: Tcl Simple Flow Control

.N.center[
Hint: Copy long command lines from here and paste into the Tcl Shell.
]

.pull-left[
Counting down to zero:
```
set x 10
while {$x} {puts [incr x -1]}
```
]
.pull-right[
Colourful counting:
```
set colours {RED GREEN BLUE}
foreach c $colours {puts $c}
```
]

Be aware of white space – its use is sometime syntactically significant!._[]
```
for {set x 10} {$x > 0} {incr x -1} {puts $x}
for {set i 0} {$i <= 10} {incr i} {puts $i}
puts "x=$x, i=$i" ;# just being curious
```

Ready for some (inter-) action?
```
puts -nonewline "your name? "
if {[gets stdin name] > 0} { puts "hi $name, have a nice day!" }
```

.F[:
If you didn't use *Copy&Paste* or command execution failed, use it now.
]

template: plain
header: ## Part 5: Tcl Errors and Recovery

.N[
From here on, maybe put the examples in small files – say `x1.tcl`,
`x2.tcl`, … – and run the files in the Tcl Shell using `source x1.tcl`
etc.._[]
]

.pull-left[
Wanna do some math?
```
while {[gets stdin x] > 0} {
    puts "$x ==> [expr $x]"
}
```

But what happens if the math expression typed-in has an error?
]
.pull-right[
Better be a bit more tolerant:
```
while {[gets stdin x] > 0} {
    catch {
        set result [expr $x]
        puts "$x ==> $result"
    }
}
```
]

Even more perfect, let the user know what exactly went wrong:
```
while {[gets stdin x] > 0} {
    if {[catch {expr $x} result]} { puts "ERROR: $result" }\
    else                          { puts "$x ==> $result" }
}
```

.F[:
Consider this approach especially if you also want to try small variations.
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 6: Defining Tcl Subroutines

Any code of substantial length should be rather written as sub-routine.
```
proc evaluate_math_expression {} {
    while {[gets stdin x] > 0} {
        if {[catch {expr $x} result]} { puts "ERROR: $result" }\
        } else                        { puts "$x ==> $result" }
    }
}
```

This subroutine then needs to be executed:
```
evaluate_math_expression
```
(Of course, this can also be done more than once.._[])

.F[:
When you started working with your Tcl code in a separate file, only **put the
subroutine definition** in the file, and make an explicit call after its has
been source. Especially if you sub-routines with arguments and return values
this makes testing easier.
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 7: Tcl Subroutine Arguments

.pull-left[
```
proc math_expression {x vr} {
    upvar $vr result
    if {[catch {expr $x} z]} {
        set result "ERROR: $z"
    } else {
        set result "$x ==> $z"
    }
}
```
Test this **first** with calls like:
```
math_expression 3+4 r; puts $r
```
Change the first argument to supply different test input.
]
.pull-right[
```
proc evaluation_loop {fh} {
    set n 1
    while {[gets fh x] > 0} {
        math_expression $x res
        puts "($n) $res"
        incr n
    }
}
```
Test this **second** with the call:
```
evaluation_loop stdin
```
Supply different test input interactively.
]

Make sure to understand how parameter values and variables are handed forth
and back between the subroutines and their calls.._[]

.F[:
Optional: Change communicating the result back from `math_expression` to use 
the return.
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 8: Tcl Subroutine Return Values

.N.center[
This is also the solution for the change suggested in Footnote of Part 7.
]

.pull-left[
```
proc math_expression {x} {
    if {[catch {expr $x} z]} {
        return "ERROR: $z"
    } else {
        return "$x ==> $z"
    }
}
```
Test this **first** with calls like:
```
math_expression 3+4
```
Change the first argument to supply different test input.
]
.pull-right[
```
proc evaluation_loop {fh} {
    set n 0
    while {[gets $fh x] > 0} {
        set res [
            math_expression $x
        ]
        puts "([incr n]) $res"
    }
}
```
Test this **second** (as in Part 7) and also compare with the
previous version:

* What exactly was changed?._[]
]

.F[:
Were there also changes **unrelated** to the communication between the
two functions?
