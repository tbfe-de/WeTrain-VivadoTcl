template:plain
header: ## Part 1: Using Vivado as Tcl-Shell

.N.center[
**All parts of this Lab** are *Pure Tcl* – nothing is Vivado specific.
]

Nevertheless use Vivado as Tcl-Shell in one of the following ways:

* Start *Vivado in GUI Mode* and use the *Tcl Console* to:
  * Enter Tcl commands in its *Command line*
  * View the result in its *Output Window*

* **Or:** Start Vivado in GUI mode, then:
  * Enter `stop_gui` at the *Tcl Console Command Line*
  * Continue to work in with *Vivado in Tcl Mode*
  * (How would you terminate your Tcl session then?)

* **Or:** Directly start *Vivado in Tcl Mode*:
  * (When done with everything, enter `exit` as command.)

template: plain
header: ## Part 2: Some Simple Tcl Commands

.N.center[
Directly type-in the commands (as interactive input).
]

.pull-left[
Print a greet:
```
puts "hello, world"
```

As before, but in two lines:
```
puts "hello\nworld"
```

Just a comment:
```
# just a comment
```

Show Tcl version:
```
puts $tcl_version
```
]
.pull-right[
Value of PI:
```
expr 2*acos(0.0)
```

Files in working dirctory:
```
glob *
```

Current time:
```
clock seconds
```

Explain this:
```
set tcl_version
```
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 2: Using Tcl Variables

.N[
Note that once set, a variable keeps its value until it is `unset`.
]

.pull-left[
```
set greet "hello, world"
puts $greet
```

Playing games with `expr`:
```
set PI_half acos(0.0)
puts $PI_half
expr $PI_half
expr 2*$PI_half
set PI 2*$PI_half
expr $PI
puts $PI
```

Environment Variables:
```
puts $env(PATH)
puts $env(HOME)
```
]
.pull-right[
Predefined Variables:
```
array get env
info vars
info vars tcl_* 
array get tcl_platform
info vars a*
```
Looking around in the file system:
```
pwd
cd ..
pwd
glob *
glob * -type directory
file stat $env(HOME) attrs
array get attrs
info vars a*
```
]

template: plain
header: ## Part 3: Tcl Command Return Values

.pull-left[
First, understand this!._[]
```
expr 1+1
puts [expr 1+1]
expr 6*7
puts [expr 6*7]
expr 1+1;expr 6*7
puts [expr 1+1];puts [expr 6*7]
```

PI again:
```
# same, same, but different
set PI_half [expr acos(0.0)]
set PI [expr 2*$PI]
puts $PI_half; puts $PI
```
]
.pull-right[
And still counting …
```
# the hard way
set x 1; puts $x
set x [expr $x+1]; puts $x

# and the easy one
puts [set x 42]
puts [incr x]
puts [incr x -10]
```

(No) More Time:
```
set now [clock seconds]
format [clock format $now]
```
]

.F[:
When interactively working with a Tcl Shell – as a service – the **return
value of the last command** is displayed. In you put two or more commands in
one line (separated with a semicolon) you will only see the return value of
the **last** command.  
The situation changes when `puts` **generates explicit output**.
Then – of course – nothing will be silently swept under the carpet if there
are several `puts` commands in one line.
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 4: Tcl Simple Flow Control

.N.center[
Hint: Copy long command lines from here and paste into the Tcl Shell.
]

.pull-left[
Counting down to zero:
```
set x 10
while {$x} {puts [incr x -1]}
```
]
.pull-right[
Colourful counting:
```
set colours {RED GREEN BLUE}
foreach c $colours {puts $c}
```
]

Be aware of white space – its use is sometime syntactically significant!._[]
```
for {set x 10} {$x > 0} {incr x -1} {puts $x}
for {set i 0} {$i <= 10} {incr i} {puts $i}
puts "x=$x, i=$i" ;# just being curious
```

Ready for some (inter-) action?
```
puts -nonewline "your name? "
if {[gets stdin name] > 0} { puts "hi $name, have a nice day!" }
```

.F[:
If you didn't use *Copy&Paste* or command execution failed, use it now.
]

template: plain
header: ## Part 5: Tcl Errors and Recovery

.N[
From here on, maybe put the examples in small files – say `x1.tcl`,
`x2.tcl`, … – and run the files in the Tcl Shell using `source x1.tcl`
etc.._[]
]

.pull-left[
Wanna do some math?
```
while {[gets stdin x] > 0} {
    puts "$x ==> [expr $x]"
}
```

But what happens if the math expression typed-in has an error?
]
.pull-right[
Better be a bit more tolerant:
```
while {[gets stdin x] > 0} {
    catch {
        set result [expr $x]
        puts "$x ==> $result"
    }
}
```
]

Even more perfect, let the user know what exactly went wrong:
```
while {[gets stdin x] > 0} {
    if {[catch {expr $x} result]} { puts "ERROR: $result" }\
    else                          { puts "$x ==> $result" }
}
```

.F[:
Consider this approach especially if you also want to try small variations.
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 6: Defining Tcl Subroutines

Any code of substantial length should be rather written as sub-routine.
```
proc evaluate_math_expression {} {
    while {[gets stdin x] > 0} {
        if {[catch {expr $x} result]} { puts "ERROR: $result" }\
        } else                        { puts "$x ==> $result" }
    }
}
```

This subroutine then needs to be executed:
```
evaluate_math_expression
```
(Of course, this can also be done more than once.._[])

.F[:
When you started working with your Tcl code in a separate file, only **put the
subroutine definition** in the file, and make an explicit call after its has
been source. Especially if you sub-routines with arguments and return values
this makes testing easier.
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 7: Tcl Subroutine Arguments

.pull-left[
```
proc math_expression {x vr} {
    upvar $vr result
    if {[catch {expr $x} z]} {
        set result "ERROR: $z"
    } else {
        set result "$x ==> $z"
    }
}
```
Test this **first** with calls like:
```
math_expression 3+4 r; puts $r
```
Change the first argument to supply different test input.
]
.pull-right[
```
proc evaluation_loop {fh} {
    set n 1
    while {[gets fh x] > 0} {
        math_expression $x res
        puts "($n) $res"
        incr n
    }
}
```
Test this **second** with the call:
```
evaluation_loop stdin
```
Supply different test input interactively.
]

Make sure to understand how parameter values and variables are handed forth
and back between the subroutines and their calls.._[]

.F[:
Optional: Change communicating the result back from `math_expression` to use 
the return.
]

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 8: Tcl Subroutine Return Values

.N.center[
This is also the solution for the change suggested in Footnote of Part 7.
]

.pull-left[
```
proc math_expression {x} {
    if {[catch {expr $x} z]} {
        return "ERROR: $z"
    } else {
        return "$x ==> $z"
    }
}
```
Test this **first** with calls like:
```
math_expression 3+4
```
Change the first argument to supply different test input.
]
.pull-right[
```
proc evaluation_loop {fh} {
    set n 0
    while {[gets $fh x] > 0} {
        set res [
            math_expression $x
        ]
        puts "([incr n]) $res"
    }
}
```
Test this **second** (as in Part 7) and also compare the code:

* What exactly was changed?._[]
]

.F[:
Were there also changes **unrelated** to the communication between the
two functions?
]

template: plain
header: ## Part 9: Tcl Quoting … (Hell?)

.N.center[
**Note that all examples below are correct Tcl syntax!**  
(In case of failure you made a typo – so better use *Copy&Paste*.)
]

.pull-left[
Many ways to skin the cat …
```
puts hello,\ world
puts "hello, world"
puts {hello, world}
puts -nonewline hello,\ world\n
puts "hello,\
      world"
puts\
hello\ world
puts hello,\040world
puts hello,\x20world
puts hello,\u0020world
puts [concat hello, world]
puts h\e\l\l\o\,\ \w\or\l\d
```
]
.pull-right[
… but:._[]
```
puts h\e\l\l\o\,\ \w\o\r\l\d
```
And still some:
```
set a "{"; set b \}; set c {"}
set d "\\"; set e \\; set f \;
set p {\}}; set u { }; set x {}
set q {\\}; set v " "; set y ""
set r {\{}; set w \ ; set z ''
foreach v {
  a b c d e f p q r u v w x y z
} { puts ">[set $v]<" }
```
]

.F[:
You'll have to look **really** close when comparing the next line on this side
to the last line on the left side!  
And just for the sake of the challenge:
*What if the last line on the right read:* `puts\ >\[set\ \$v]<` *?*

template: plain
header: ## CONGRATULATION

So far you have finished the first LAB …

… or at least reached the "meeting point" from which you will be picked up when
the course continues.

.N.center[
You are now free to pause here or to continue with the remaining parts.._[]
]

Everything what follows is related to Tcl lists, which are an important data
structure in Vivado.

.N.center[
Many Vivado commands return result lists, so knowing about Tcl lists will
surely pay or – at the least – avoid some "trial and error loops" when you
want to write robust Tcl scripts.
]

.F[:
If you do not continue now, it is suggested you take the time to walk through
the remaining parts at least before you start writing Tcl scripts for Vivado
as part of your productive work.

llength [lindex $li 0]
lindex $i 1
llength [lindex $li 1]
lindex $i 2

lindex $i end-1
lindex [lindex $li 1] 2}
lindex $li {1 2}
lindex $li {2 1}
lindex $li {2 0}
```
]
.pull-right[
```
lindex $li {0 2}
lindex $li {0 1}
lindex $li {0 0 0}
lrange $li 3 end
lrange $li 0 end-1
lrange $li 3 3
lindex $li 3
lreplace $li 3 3 Newhaven

header: ## Part 11: Tcl List Manipulation

**All** the commands on the **left** and **all** the commands on the **right**
are mainly meant to work with lists – but what is the principle difference
between those in the left column and those in the right?

.N.center[

[`join`]:   https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/join.htm
[`foreach`]:   https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/foreach.htm

Assuming a list `li`, there is nothing "wrong" with this code, is'nt it?
```
for {set i 0} {$i < [llength $li]} {incr i} { puts [lindex $li $i] }
```

Describe the effect of the following two fragments, demonstrating the usage of
`foreach` and `join`?._[]
.pull-left[
```
foreach v $li { puts $v }
```
]
.pull-right[
```
puts [join $li \n]
```

Analyze the following code (assuming there are two lists `li1` and `li2`):
```
foreach v [concat $li1 $li2] { puts $v }
foreach {v1 v2} li1          { puts "$v1 $v2" }
foreach v1 $li1 v2 $li2      { puts "$v1 $v2" }
```

.F[:
Note that there **in fact is** a difference, though a subtle one … (which also
can be made to go away in a subtle way).

header: ## Part 13: Tcl List Unpacking

[`set`]:   https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/set.htm
[`lassign`]:   https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/lassign.htm
[`foreach`]:   https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/foreach.htm

How is the below fragment – demonstrating a less frequent usage form of
[`foreach`] (and also [`set`]._[])
```
foreach v {v1 v2 v3 v4} e $li {set $v $e}
```

different from the following one – demonstrating the use of [`lassign`]:
```
lassign $li v1 v2 v3 v4

Hint: Consider the case where `li` holds not **exactly** 4 elements.

.N.center[
You may need to consult the Online Manual and look-up [`lassign`].

.F[:
YES! This is one of the rare cases where you really would want to write
`set` **`$`**`v` … (not: `set v` …).

template: plain
header: ## Part 14: Tcl List Creation

Up to here, lists were created literally and it felt somewhat naturally:
```
set colours {RED GREEN BLUE} ;# <--------------------- from Part 4
foreach v {
  a b c d e f p q r u v w x y z
} …                          ;# <--------------------- from Part 9
set li {                          
    Bartonsville {Avon by the Sea} Nehawka {Plum Grove} Funkstown
}                            ;# <--------------------- from Part 10
foreach {v1 v2} …            ;# <--------------------- from Part 12
foreach v {v1 v2 v3 v4} …    ;# <--------------------- from Part 13
```

.N.center[
So, what could be wrong with this?
]

Consider the case were a list could may contain variable content:
```
set li "Hamburg {Frankfurt am Main} $mycity München"   ;# not good!
set li "Hamburg {Frankfurt am Main} {$mycity} München"   ;# better?
…
set li [list Hamburg {Frankfurt am Main} $mycity München ;# PERFECT
```

---
template: plain
header: ## Part 15: Tcl Quoting and Lists

[`gets`]:   https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/gets.htm
[`string`]:   https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/string.htm

First analyze._[] the following code fragment …
```
while {[gets stdin mycity] >= 0 && ![string equal $mycity .]} {
    set cities "Hamburg {Frankfurt am Main} {$mycity} München"
    puts [format "%d cities, I live in %s"\
                 [llength $cities]\
                 [lindex $cities 2]]
}
```

… then find some input which would cause it to crash.

Finally replace the line where the list `cities` is created with this one:
```
    set cities [list Hamburg {Frankfurt am Main} $mycity München]
```

.N.center[
Now try again – **Good Luck!**
]

.F[:
One result of your analysis may be that you can stop the input loop by typing
a dot (`.`) as only input character, but empty lines are acceptable input.
(Why is this? Just RTFM: [`gets`] and maybe [`string`] too!)
