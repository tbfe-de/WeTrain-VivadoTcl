header: ## Part 1: Project Mode Filesets

.N.center[
Start Vivado and create the Vivado Example Project `Wavegen`.
]

* As *Name* for the project use `wavegen_1` (instead of `project_1`) and for
  the moment do not run any other step (like *Synthesis* etc.)

* How can you determine which Vivado Tcl Commands have been executed?

  * Where does the project name become part of these commands?
  * Where the directory that stores the project files?
  * Where the "XILINX part"?

* Where is the same information (project name, directory, XILINX part) located
  in the Vivado GUI?

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 1: Working with Filesets

Execute the following commands from the Vivado Tcl Console:
.pull-left[
```
get_project
current_fileset
current_fileset -constr
```
]
.pull-right[
Watch the Tcl Console Output for the return values and determine where the
same information is provided via the Vivado GUI.
]

What kind of fileset is created with the following command?
.pull-left[
```
create_fileset my_fileset
```
]
.pull-right[
And where is the new fileset shown in the GUI?
]

Execute the following commands one by one._[] and track via the GUI:
```
set s [get_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE [get_filesets constrs_1]]
set_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE $s [get_filesets my_fileset]
delete_fileset my_fileset
```

.F[:
To avoid typos consider to *Copy&Paste* the commands from this document.
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 2: Design Objects vs. Names

Run the commands from the previous step again with a small variation:
```
create_fileset my_fileset
set s [get_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE constrs_1]
set_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE $s my_fileset
delete_fileset my_fileset
```

Which commands do fail now – and why?

Make sure `my_fileset` is removed and try again as follows:
```
set f [create_fileset my_fileset]
set s [get_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE [get_filesets constrs_1]]
set_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE $s $f
delete_fileset $f
```

Do you recognize the difference between a Fileset *Object* and its *Name*?._[]

.F[:
If so, you should be able to identify which of the above commands needs a
*Fileset Name*, which one **absolutely** requires a *Fileset Object*, and which
can work with both.
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 3: File Objects

Predict the output to the Tcl Console for the following command:._[]
.pull-left[
```
set files [get_files *.v]
foreach f $files {puts $f}
```
]
.pull-right[
(Setting the variable `files` is also important for what follows below.)
]

First guess, then try out to determine the effect of the following commands:
.pull-left[
```
set f [lindex $files 0]
get_property IS_ENABLED $f
```
]
.pull-right[
**After** this disable the file via the GUI, **then repeat** to verify.
]

Now re-enable the file with the following Tcl Command …
.pull-left[
```
set_property IS_ENABLED TRUE $f
```
]
.pull-right[
… and again use the GUI to verify the effect.
]

.F[:
Simply printing the file names can also be achieved in a different way, but be
sure to understand that the "object-nes" of the files gets removed by it:
`puts -nonewline [join [get_files *.v] \n]`
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 3: File Objects (cont.)

When creating a list of objects it is often better to filter early but late.

Compare the following:
```
set files [list]
foreach f [get_files *.v] {
    if {![get_property IS_ENABLED $f]} {
        lappend files $f
    }
}
```

And the alternative:
```
set files [get_files *.v -filter {!IS_ENABLED}]
```

* Which option needs to be added in the second case to get **exactly** the same
effect from both code fragments?

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Optional Tcl Challenge

With respect to the *Source File Set* of a project you will find that

* Vivado obviously **knows** about the modification time of each file as that
  time-stamp it is displayed with the *General File Proerties* …

* … but if you look at the *Properties* of a *File Object* you will find
  **nothing** corresponding to it.

.N.center[
So how to produce a list of file names sorted by modification time?
]

You may now

* either try to solve this yourself
* or review the solution on the next page.

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Tcl Challenge Solved

Here is a possible solution for the Tcl Challenge on the previous page:
```
proc files_by_decreasing_mtime {names} {
    foreach fn $names {
        lappend fn_mt [list $fn [file mtime $fn]]
    }
    foreach ft [lsort -decreasing -index 1 -integer $fn_mt] {
        lassign $ft fn mt
        set ts [clock format $mt -format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"]
        puts "$ts - $fn"
    }
}
```

The intended usage is like this:
```
files_by_decreasing_mtime [get_files *.v -filter {IS_ENABLED}]
```

template:plain
header: ## Part 2: Navigating Design Objects

.N.center[
Open the Elaborated Design of the Vivado Example Project `Wavegen`.
]

This part focusses on

* **Navigation by Name** through

* *Hierarchically Related Design Objects*.

It is similar to navigating hierarchical objects of a *Block Design*,
a topic that will receive further coverage later.

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Step 1: Naming Hierarchical Design Objects

For the following two commands, explain the difference in their output:._[]
.pull-left[
```
llength [get_cells *]
```
]
.pull-right[
```
llength [get_cells -hier *]
```
]

Can you predict the **limits** inside which the result (i.e. number of cells
returned) for following Vivado Tcl Command should be?
.pull-left[
```
llength [get_cells */*]
```
]
.pull-right[
```
llength [get_cells */*/*]
```
]

Does it make sense to add more and more wild-cards like in
```
llength [get_cells */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*]
```
or is there a sensible limit (depending on the depth of nesting)?

.F[:
As usual – RTFM whenever you need additional informations! This course will
"show you around" to places that might be of interest, but for any detailed
information you are on your own (of course, with the trainer around to offer
a helping hand if you request it).
]

template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Step 2: Navigating Hierarchical Design Objects

.N.center[
In the *Schematic* (Diagram) locate the top-level cell `uart_rx_i0`.
]

* Zoom the diagram so that you can open the cell and expand its elements.

* One by one run the following Vivado Tcl Commands and watch their effect:
```
highlight_objects [get_cells uart_rx_i0/*]
current_instance uart_rx_i0
unhighlight_objects [get_cells *]
```
* Watch and explain the effects of these commands on (some of) the objects
  displayed in the Vivado GUI.

  * What still has **permanently** changed?
  * How would you undo it?._[]

.F[:
To answer the preceeing question first: Of course, `current_instance` does
not yet (again) point to the top of the design, **be sure to reset it
before you continue with:**  
`current_instance` (without arguments).

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Optional Tcl Challenge

```
proc show_leaf_cells {n {p ""}} {
    if {[catch {current_instance $n}]} {
        puts "$p$n"
    } else {

        }
        current_instance -quiet ..
    }

Assuming you have the *Wavegen Example Project* still open you may *Copy&Paste*

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Optional Tcl Challenge (cont.)

Discuss the pro's and con's of the solution from the previous page to the
following approach:
```
proc show_leaf_cells {n} {
    current_instance $n
    foreach c [get_cells * -hier -filter IS_PRIMITIVE] {
        puts $c
    }
    current_instance -quiet ..
}   
```

* Which draw-backs of the original solution have been solved?
* Are there still short-comings – obvious ones or less obvious ones?
* Any ideas how those might be overcome?

.N.center[
Especially how to avoid the temporary change to `current_instance`?
]

You may now

* either try to solve this yourself
* or review the solution on the next page.

template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Tcl Challenge Solved

The following subroutine._[] combines selection by `NAME` and the `IS_PRIMITIVE`
property in the filter expression:
```
proc show_leaf_cells {n} {
    foreach c [get_cells * -hier\
               -filter "NAME =~ $n/* && IS_PRIMITIVE"] {
        puts $c
    }
}
```

.N.center[
Be sure to understand why the filter expression needs to be  
in double quotes, not curly braces.
]

.F[:
Here's another one, avoiding the explicit loop altogether (but probably less readable):
```
proc show_leaf_cells {n} {
    puts -nonewline [join [get_cells * -hier -filter "NAME =~ $n/* && IS_PRIMITIVE"] '\n']
}
```

template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 1: From Ports to Nets to Pins …

Open the *Schematic*, bring element `rxd_pin` (located top/left) into view, and
enter the following commands (one by one)._[],

.pull-left[
```
set p [get_ports rxd_pin]
highlight_objects $p
set n [get_nets -of_objects $p]
highlight_objects $n
```
]
.pull-right[
For each step try to predict what will happen and compare with what actually
happens (zooming in and out as necessary).
]

Continue with:
```
unhighlight_object $p
set p [get_pins -of_objects $n -filter { Direction == In }]
highlight_objects $p
```

.F[:
It is recommended to *Copy&Paste* the commands from the online version of this
Lab to the command line of the *Vivado Tcl Console*.

template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 2: From Pins to Cells to Pins to Nets …

Continue with:
```
unhighlight_objects $n
set n [get_cells -of_objects $p]
highlight_objects $n
unhighlight_object $p
set p [get_pins -of_objects $n -filter { Direction == Out }]
highlight_objects $p
```

With respect to highlighting, does the schematic currently look **exactly** how
would have predicted it?
* If YES, run the next step.
* If NO, run the next step.
```
unhighlight_objects $n
```
* Now OK?
* Or not OK?

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 3: From Nets to Cells (… to Nets again …)

Run the following commands, first individually or as a group …
```
highlight_objects [set n [get_nets -of $p]]
unhighlight_object $p
highlight_objects [set p [get_pins -of $n -filter Direction==In]]
unhighlight_objects $n
highlight_objects [set n [get_cells -of $p]]
unhighlight_object $p
highlight_objects [set p [get_pins -of $n -filter Direction==Out]]
```

.pull-left[
```
unhighlight_objects $n
…
```
]
.pull-right[
After an initial un-highlighting, repeat the above commands.._[]
]

.F[:
For comparison and/or easy *Cut&Paste*, here's the full sequence once more,
slightly re-formatted:
```
unhighlight_objects $n
highlight_objects [set n [get_nets -of_objects $p]]
unhighlight_object $p
highlight_objects [set p [get_pins -of_objects $n -filter { Direction == In }]]
after 1000 ;# delay for a second here
unhighlight_objects $n
highlight_objects [set n [get_cells -of_objects $p]]
unhighlight_object $p
highlight_objects [set p [get_pins -of_objects $n -filter { Direction == Out }]]
```
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Optional Tcl Challenge

Review and explain the following code …
```
proc set_highlighted {key {objs {}}} {
    global highlighted
    if {[info exists highlighted($key)]\
     && [llength $highlighted($key)] > 0} {
        unhighlight_objects $highlighted($key)
    }
    if {[llength $objs] > 0} {
        highlight_objects $objs
    }
    set highlighted($key) $objs
}
```

… then *Copy&Paste* it to the *Vivado Tcl Console* and try the following:
```
set_highlighted my_cells [get_cells]        ; after 1000
set_highlighted my_nets [set n [get_nets]]  ; after 1000
set_highlighted my_nets [lreplace $n 5 end] ; after 1000

template: plain
header: ### Part 4 / Step 2: Create a Block Design Components

In the *Diagram* (canvas)

* *Right Click* and (in the pop-up menu) chose *Add IP*
  * *Double Click* on *Adder/Subtracter*

* *Right Click* once more and chose *Add IP*
  * *Double Click* on *Constant*

* *Click* on the *Constant* (just created), to make it selected
  * then in the *Block Properties* Window
     * (if not already active) select Tab *General*
         * change the *Name* to `v1`

        * expand the entry *CONFIG* and
           * set *WIDTH* to *3*

Review the changes just made to the *Constant*, named `v1` now.

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 4 / Step 3: Copy Paste and Reconfigure Elements

In the *Diagram* (canvas)

* Click into *Constant* `v1` (to make it selected)
  * *Copy* (CTRL-C) and
  * *Paste* (CTRL-V) it

**Note that this automatically sets the name to `v2`.**

* Display the *Block Properties* of
  * the *Constant* `v2`
     * (feel free to its *Value*)
  * the *Adder/Subtracter*
     * change its *Name* to `adder`

On the *Diagram* review the changes just made.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optionally continue with …
* *Right-Click* into the *Diagram* and chose *Regenerate Layout*
* then from Vivado's main menu bar chose *Edit* → *Undo* …

… and review the related commands in the *Vivado Tcl Console Output*.

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 4 / Step 4: Connect Components

In the *Diagram*

* Move the mouse pointer `v1/dout[2:0]`  
  (changing its shape to a pencil),
  * then draw a connection to `adder/A[14:0]`
  * and do the same for `v2` and `adder` input `B`
* Move the mouse pointer over `v1`  
  (changing its shape to a hand)
  * then drag `v1` to the left of `adder`
  * same for `v2` (place it below `v1`)

If the diagram looks convoluted (or anyway, just out of curiosity)

* *Right-Click* and chose *Regenerate Layout*._[]

.F[:
If there are still crossed-over connections as `v2` has been placed higher as
`v1`, you may have a hard-time now, as if you manually move `v1` higher as
`v2` Vivado now chooses to cross-over the connection twice. As work-around you
may try a brute-force solution: delete both connections (while `v1` is placed
higher than `v2`) and reconnect to `adder/A` and `adder/B`.

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 4 / Step 5: Create Hierarchies

In the *Diagram*

* *Right-Click* and chose *Create Hierarchy*
  * set its *Name* to `inputs` (*Click OK*)
* drag `v1` and `v2` inside `inputs` and
* if necessary expand it (*Click* on [+] in the top-left corner)

Select **both**, `inputs` **and** `adder`.._[]
* *Right-Click* and (from the pop-up menu) choose *Create Hierarchy*
  * set *Cell Name* to `BD` and
  * verify *Move selected blocks to hierarchy* is checked (*Click OK*)
* *Right-Click* and choose *Create Port*
  * set *Port name* to `sum`
  * and *Direction* to `output`,
  * check *Create Vector* and
  * set *from:to* to `3:0` (*Click OK*)
* Connect `sum[3:0]` with `BD/adder/S[14:0]`

.F[:
To do so hold the CTRL-key down while *Click*-ing on the 2<sup>nd</sup>.

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 4 / Step 6: Reconfigure Block Design Elements

In the *Diagram*

* *Right-Click* on the `adder` and choose *Customize Block*
  * change *Input Type* and *Width* for *A* and *B* to `Unsigned` and `3`
  * change *Output Width* to `4` (*Click OK*)

**Observe that pin `BD/S[14:0]` did not change.**

* Select `BD/S[14:0]` and
  * in *Block Pin Properties*
     * select Tab *Properties* …
     * … only to find:

**Properties *LEFT* and *RIGHT* are read-only!**

* So, to fix this you need to
  * **completely remove** the connection
  * (including `BD/S[3:0]`)
  * **and reconnect** `BD/adder/S[3:0]` with `sum[3:0]`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe – if you like – finally *Right Click* and chose *Regenerate Layout*.

header: ### Part 4 / Step 8: Naming with Regular Expressions

For the following commands predict which *Cell Names* they match, i.e. the
regular expression used
* **need to have correct syntax**
* and **should match anything** at all.._[]

.pull-left[
```
get_bd_cells -regex {*}
get_bd_cells -regex {.*}
get_bd_cells -regex {.*/i*}
get_bd_cells -regex {.*/i.*}
get_bd_cells -regex {.*/inputs}
get_bd_cells -regex {BD/*}
get_bd_cells -regex {BD/.*}
get_bd_cells -regex {BD/*/*}
get_bd_cells -regex {BD/.*/.*}
```
]
.pull-right[
```
current_bd_instance BD/inputs
get_bd_cells -regex {v1}
get_bd_cells -regex {v1|v2}
get_bd_cells -regex {v[12]}
get_bd_cells -regex {v[0-9]+}
get_bd_cells -regex {v\d+}
current_bd_instance
get_bd_cells -hier -re {v\d+}
get_bd_cells -hier -re {.*v\d+}
```
]

Also be sure to understand that some *Regular Expressions* need to use
characters special to the Tcl Syntax Analysis:
* Which of the above  therefore **require** to be enclosed in curly braces?

.F[:
The result list returned might be empty, which usually draws a warning, unless
the option `-quiet` is used.

header: ### Part 4 / Optional Tcl Challenge

Design a Tcl solution to "clone" a pin or port, keeping all its properties
except the *TYPE*.._[]

The following need to be solved:

* For an existing port determine
  * all non-modifiable properties,
  * all modifiable properties, and
  * how it is connected with other design elements.

.N.center[
Find out how to set all this for a **newly created** port.
]

Possible approach:
* In the Block Design developed so far create a "Twin Sister" of the
  *Output Port* `sum` via the **Vivado GUI** …   
* … then look-up the commands viewed on the **Tcl Colsole** in the
  documentation – just to be sure you understood everything right,
* and finally wrap everything in an easy-to-use Tcl subroutine.

.F[:
The motivation may be to change the type of existing ports, for which there is
no direct way as the property is read-only and can only be set on creation.
