header: ## Part 1: Project Mode Filesets

.N.center[
Start Vivado and create the Vivado Example Project `Wavegen`.
]

* Use `wavegen_1` (instead of `project_1`) as project name and for the moment
  do not (yet) run any other step (like *Synthesis* etc.)

* How can you easily determine which Vivado Tcl Commands have been executed?

  * Where does the project name appear as part of that commands?
  * The directory to store the project files?
  * The XILINX part?

* Where is the same information (project name, directory, XILINX part) located
  in the Vivado GUI?

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 1: Working with Filesets

Execute the following commands from the Vivado Tcl Console:
.pull-left[
```
get_project
current_fileset
current_fileset -constr
```
]
.pull-right[
Watch the Tcl Console Output for the return values and determine where that
information is provided in the Vivado GUI too.
]

What kind of fileset is created with the following command?
.pull-left[
```
create_fileset my_fileset
```
]
.pull-right[
And where shows it up in the GUI?
]

Execute the following commands one by one._[] and track via the GUI:
```
set s [get_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE [get_filesets constrs_1]]
set_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE $s [get_filesets my_fileset]
delete_fileset my_fileset
```

.F[:
To avoid typos consider to *Copy&Paste* the commands from this document.
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 2: Design Objects vs. Names

Run the commands from the previous step again with a small variation:
```
create_fileset my_fileset
set s [get_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE constrs_1]
set_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE $s my_fileset
delete_fileset my_fileset
```

Which commands do fail now – and why?

Make sure `my_fileset` is removed and try again as follows:
```
set f [create_fileset my_fileset]
set s [get_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE [get_filesets constrs_1]]
set_property TARGET_CONSTRS_FILE $s $f
delete_fileset $f
```

Do you recognize the difference between a Fileset *Object* and its *Name*?._[]

.F[:
If so, you should be able to identify which of the above commands needs a
*Fileset Name*, which one **absolutely* requires a *Fileset Object*, and which
can work with both.
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 3: File Objects

Predict the output to the Tcl Console for the following command:._[]
.pull-left[
```
set files [get_files *.v]
foreach f $files {puts $f}
```
]
.pull-right[
(Setting the variable `files` is also important for what follows below.)
]

First guess then try out to determine the effect of these commands:
.pull-left[
```
set f [lindex $files 0]
get_property IS_ENABLED $f
```
]
.pull-right[
Disable the file via the GUI and repeat to verify.
]

Now re-enable the file with the following Tcl Command …
.pull-left[
```
set_property IS_ENABLED TRUE $f
```
]
.pull-right[
… and use the GUI to verify.
]

.F[:
Simply printing the file names can also be achieved in a different way but be
sure to understand that the "object-nes" of the files gets removed by it:
`puts -nonewline [join [get_files *.v] \n]`
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 3: File Objects (cont.)

When creating a list of objects it is often better to filter early but late.

Compare the following:
```
set files [list]
foreach f [get_files *.v] {
    if {![get_property IS_ENABLED $f]} {
        lappend list $f
    }
}
```

And the alternative:
```
set files [get_files *.v -filter {!IS_ENABLED}
```

* Which option needs to be added in the second case to get **exactly** the same
effect from both commands?

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Optional Tcl Challenge

With respect to the *Source File Set* of a project you will find that

* Vivado obviously **knows** about the modification time of each file as it is
  displayed with the *General File Proerties* …

* … but if you look Properties of a *File Object* you will find nothing that
  corresponds to it.

.N.center[
So how to produce a list of file names is sorted by modification time?
]

You may now

* either try to solve this yourself
* or review the solution on the next page.

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 1 / Tcl Challenge Solved

Here is a possible solution for the Tcl Challenge on the previous page:
```
proc files_by_decreasing_mtime {names} {
    foreach fn $names {
        lappend fn_mt [list $fn [file mtime $fn]]
    }
    foreach ft [lsort -decreasing -index 1 -integer $fn_mt] {
        lassign $ft fn mt
        set ts [clock format $mt -format "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"]
        puts "$ts - $fn"
    }
}
```

The intended usage is like this:
```
files_by_decreasing_mtime [get_files *.v -filter {IS_ENABLED}]
```

header: ## Part 2: Navigating Design Objects

.N.center[
Open the Elaborated Design of the Vivado Example Project `Wavegen`.
]

This part focusses on

* **Navigation by Name** through

* *Hierarchically Related Design Objects*.

It is similar to navigating hierarchical objects of a *Block Design* and
therefore the topic will receive further coverage there.

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Step 1: Naming Hierarchical Design Objects

For the following two commands, explain the difference in their output:._[]
.pull-left[
```
llength [get_cells *]
```
]
.pull-right[
```
llength [get_cells -hier *]
```
]

Can you predict the **limits** inside which the result (i.e. number of cells
returned) for following Vivado Tcl Command should be?
.pull-left[
```
llength [get_cells */*]
```
]
.pull-right[
```
llength [get_cells */*/*]
```
]

Does it make sense to add more and more wild-cards like in
```
llength [get_cells */*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*]
```
or is there a sensible limit (depending on the depth of nesting)?

.F[:
As usual – RTFM whenever you need additional informations! This course will
"show you around" to places that might be of interest, but for any detailed
information you are on your own (of course, with the trainer around to offer
a helping hand if you request it).
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Step 2: Navigating Hierarchical Design Objects

.N.center[
In the *Schematic* (Diagram) locate the top-level cell `uart_rx_i0`.
]

* Zoom the diagram so that you can open the cell and expand its elements.

* One by one run the following Vivado Tcl Commands and watch their effect:
```
highlight_objects [get_cells uart_rx_i0/*]
current_instance uart_rx_0
unhighlight_objects *
```
* Watch and explain the effects of these commands on (some of) the objects
  displayed in the Vivado GUI.

  * What still has **permanently** changed?
  * How would you undo it?

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Optional Tcl Challenge

Review the following Tcl subroutine and determine what it does:._[]
```
proc show_leaf_cells {n {p ""}} {
    if {[catch {current_instance $n}]} {
        puts "$p$n"
    } else {
        foreach c [get_cells *] {
            set cs [split $c /]
            show_leaf_cell [lindex $cs end]\
                           [join [lreplace $cs end end] /]/
        }
        current_instance -quiet ..
    }
}
```

.pull-left[
* By trying like shown right.
* By guessing from the name.
* By analyzing its body.
]
.pull-right[
```
show_leaf_cells uart_rx_i0
```
]

.F[:
Assuming you have the *Wavegen Example Project* still open you may *Copy&Paste*
the code from here to the Tcl Console (as input).
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Optional Tcl Challenge (cont.)

Discuss the pro's and con's of the solution from the previous page to the
following approach:
```
proc show_leaf_cells {n} {
    current_instance $n
    foreach c [get_cells * -hier -filter IS_PRIMITIVE] {
        puts $c
    }
    current_instance -quiet ..
}   
```

* Which draw-backs of the original solution have been solved.
* Are there still short-comings – obvious ones or less obvious ones.
* Any ideas how those might be overcome?

.N.center[
Especially how to avoid the temporary change to `current_instance`?
]

You may now

* either try to solve this yourself
* or review the solution on the next page.

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Tcl Challenge Solved

The following subroutine._[] combines selection by `NAME` and the `IS_PRIMITIVE`
property in the filter expression:
```
proc show_leaf_cells {n} {
    foreach c [get_cells * -hier\
               -filter "NAME =~ $n/* && IS_PRIMITIVE"] {
        puts $c
    }
}
```

.N.center[
Be sure to understand why the filter expression needs to be  
in double quotes, not curly braces.
]

.F[:
Here's another one, avoiding the explicit loop altogether (but probably less readable):
```
proc show_leaf_cells {n} {
    puts -nonewline [join [get_cells * -hier -filter "NAME =~ $n/* && IS_PRIMITIVE"] '\n']
}
```
]

template:plain
header: ## Part 3: Navigating via Connections

.N.center[
Open or continue with the Elaborated Design of Example `Wavegen`.

This part focusses on

* **Navigation By Relationship**

through connected Design Objects.._[]

.F[:
The term "connected" is used here for both, physical and logical connections.  
For an overview diagram see: [XILINX UG894] → … → *Getting Objects by Relationships* (Page 46);  
a more complete diagram is in: [XILINX UG835] → … → *Object Relationships* (Page 15);  
two even more detailed (but still partial) diagrams are in [XILINX UG912] → … →  
*Netlist and Device Objects* (Page 9) and *Block Design Objects* (Page 12),  
followed by excerpts of an exhaustive diagram in subsequent sections.

template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 1: From Ports to Nets to Pins …

Open the *Schematic*, bring element `rxd_pin` (top/left) to the center, and
enter the following commands (one by one)._[],

.pull-left[
```
set p [get_ports rxd_pin]
highlight_objects $p
set n [get_nets -of_objects $p]
highlight_objects $n
```
]
.pull-right[
For each step try to predict what will happen and compare with what happens
(maybe zooming-in and -out as necessary).
]

Continue with:
```
unhighlight_object $p
set p [get_pins -of_objects $n -filter { Direction == In }]
highlight_objects $p
```

.F[:
It is recommended to *Copy&Paste* the commands from the online version of this
Lab to the command line of the *Vivado Tcl Console*.
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 2: From Pins to Cells to Pins to Nets …

Continue with:
```
unhighlight_objects $n
set n [get_cells -of_objects $p]
highlight_objects $n
unhighlight_object $p
set p [get_pins -of_objects $n -filter { Direction == Out }]
highlight_objects $p
```

With respect to highlighting, does the schematic currently look **exactly** how
would have predicted it?
* If YES, run the next step.
* If NO, run the next step.
```
unhighlight_objects $n
```
* Now OK?
* Or not OK?

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Step 3: From Nets to Cells (… to Nets again …)

Run the following commands, first individually or as a group …
```
highlight_objects [set n [get_nets -of $p]]
unhighlight_object $p
highlight_objects [set p [get_pins -of $n -filter Direction==In]]
unhighlight_objects $n
highlight_objects [set n [get_cells -of $p]]
unhighlight_object $p
highlight_objects [set p [get_pins -of $n -filter Direction==Out]]
```

.pull-left[
```
unhighlight_objects $n
…
```
]
.pull-right[
After an initial un-highlighting, repeat the above commands.._[]
]

.F[:
For comparison and/or easy *Cut&Paste*, here's the full sequence once more,
slightly re-formatted:
```
unhighlight_objects $n
highlight_objects [set n [get_nets -of_objects $p]]
unhighlight_object $p
highlight_objects [set p [get_pins -of_objects $n -filter { Direction == In }]]
after 1000 ;# delay for a second here
unhighlight_objects $n
highlight_objects [set n [get_cells -of_objects $p]]
unhighlight_object $p
highlight_objects [set p [get_pins -of_objects $n -filter { Direction == Out }]]
```
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 3 / Optional Tcl Challenge

Review and explain the following code …
```
proc set_highlighted {key {objs {}}} {
    global highlighted
    if {[info exists highlighted($key)]\
     && [llength $highlighted($key)] > 0} {
        unhighlight_objects $objs
    }
    if {[llength $objs] > 0} {
        highlight_objects $objs
    }
    set highlighted($key) $objs
}
```

… then *Copy&Paste* it to the *Vivado Tcl Console* and try the following:
