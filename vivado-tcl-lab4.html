header: ## Part 1: Processing (Report) Files

.N.center[
The following is mainly based on [XILINX UG888] → *LAB 1*  
but centers around the *Report Generation Step*.
]

As further preparation you may want to look-up the description of the
Tcl Commands

* [`glob`] `-dir …`  
  – to determine which files are present in a directory;
* [`file`] `mtime  …`  
   – mainly to access some properties of file
* [`clock`] `format … -format …`  
   – to turn internal time stamps into the usual (human readable)
   date-time representation.
  
[`glob`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/glob.htm

template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 1: Adapting Reports in Various Ways

.N.center[
In [XILINX UG888] → *Lab 1* advance to *Step 3* (Page 11)
]

For some of._[] Vivado's Tcl `report_`-commands used here look-up their
description in [XILINX UG835].
  
* To which of the following targets can you redirect a report:
  * To a file?
  * To a variable?
  * To a special window?
  * (Try out any of the above that is possible!)

* How can you limit the content of a report?

.F[:
For the purpose of determining how a report may be re-directed to various
destinations, it is actually fully sufficient to look-up the description of
just one such command as representative example, as the relevant options are
exactly the same for all such commands.
]

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 2: Determine Modification Time of Files

Use the Tcl commands [`file`] and [`clock`] to get the modification time
of **all** the generated reports stored in files, according to the original
Lab (i.e. [XILINX UG835] → *Lab 1* → *Step 3*).
	
* How can you decide which one is the newest?

  * Do you actually need the Tcl command `clock` to do that?
  * Determine which (report) file is oldest and which newest.
  * How much time has passed between both time stamps?

* Regenerate the newest report but **keep the oldest untouched**.

  * Verify the time span between the newest report and the oldest report
    has actually increased.


---
template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 3: Preparing the Tcl Development Cycle

[`pwd`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/pwd.htm

* **Start an Editor** of your choice._[] and write a single line into it:  

```
puts "HERE-I-AM"
```

* Save it to a file `list_reports.tcl` **in the working directory** of your
  Vivado Tcl console.

  * (Tcl Command Hint: [`pwd`])

.F[:
Under Microsoft Windows, if you have installed [ActiveTcl] you can use their
editor, otherwise it is recommended to install and use *Notepad++* which can be
downloaded for free from http://notepad-plus-plus.org.
]

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 4: Sourcing the Tcl Script File

* **Back to the Vivado Console** (but leave the editor window open)

  * Check that the file `list_reports.tcl` actually exists where you have
    stored it
     * (Tcl Command Hint: `file exists …`)

  * Run the command stored in `list_reports.tcl` by using  

```
source list_reports.tcl
```

.N.center[
IMPORTANT NOTE  
If you do not get the output `HERE-I-AM` but anything else happens, either fix
the error (if you see any) or ask the trainer.
]

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 5: Abbreviations of the `source` Command


* **In the Vivado Console** (with the editor window still open)

  * Run the command in `list_reports` ones more using

```
sourc list_reports.tcl
sour list_reports.tcl
```
   * How many more letters of the Tcl Command `source` can be left out until
     you get an error message?

      * (Tcl Command Hint: `info proc so*` will help to see the problem)

* **Back to the Editor**

  * Change your file as follows:

```
proc list_reports {} {
    puts HERE-I-AM
}
```

  * Save it back to `list_reports.tcl` (overwriting previous content)
	  
---
template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 6: Source AND RUN the Subroutine

* **Back to the Vivado Console** (with the editor window still open)
  
  * Again use the command._[]

```
source list_reports.tcl
```

  * Why doesn't happen anything right away?
  * Run the sub-routine by using

```
list_reports
```
  
  * Check the current definition of the sub-routine `list_reports`

     * (Tcl Command Hint: `info body list_reports`)

* **Back to the Editor**
  
  * Change the file content to:

```
proc list_reports {} {
    glob $::outputDir/*.rpt
}

```

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 7: Run the Modified Subroutine

* **Back to the Vivado Console**

```
source list_reports.tcl
```

  * Check that the new definition of `list_reports` was loaded.
  * Run the sub-routine with:._[]

```
list_reports
```

.N[
From now on the two steps to **write-back** the file (in the editor) and
**`source`** the modified subroutine definition (in Vivado) will no longer
be mentioned explicitly.._[]
]

.F[:
And of course, once you "automatically" – without much thinking – save the
changes to the subroutine definition  `list_reports` in the editor, then
`source` the file `list_reports.tcl` in Vivado, there is no point every
time to verify the definition of the subroutine body has actually changed.
]

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Step 8: Further Enhance the Subroutine

[`glob`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/lsort.htm

* **Back to the Editor** 

  * Change the definition of `list_reports` step by step so that it
     * (1st step) list the name of all reports on output
     * (2nd step) adds in a first column the modification time  
        *`YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`*

* **Back to the Vivado Console**

  * Test the modifications you made to ` list_reports.tcl`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may now continue with Part 2, or add the following extra feature:._[]

* On output list the files ordered by their modification time,
  * oldest first,
  * most recent last.

.F[:
Hint: First write the *mtime* and the file *name* in a list, where each
element is itself a two-element list, consisting of the modification time
and the file name. Then look up to find how use the Tcl Command `lsort` can
be used to sort a "list of lists" and use a specific element from the *nested*
list as "sort key" (i.e. comparison criteria).
]

---
template: plain
header: ### Part 1 / Optional Tcl Challenge

Add **one** argument `sort_order` to `list_reports` which determine the
order of the file names on output with one of the following values:
* `-by_name` – sort alphabetically (ascending) by file name
* `-by_name_reversed` – as before but descending
* `-by_mtime` – sort (ascending) by modification time
* `-by_mtime_reversed` – as before but descending

A first sketch how `list_reports` could look like this:._[]
```
proc list_reports {sort_order} {
    switch -excat -- $sort_order {
        ... TO BE DONE ..
    }
}
```
.F[:
PLEASE look-up the description of the *Tcl Multi-Way Branch Command* `switch`
in the documentation. You may ALWAYS ask the trainer if something is not clear
there, but there are too many Standard and Vivado Tcl Commands to go beyond
hinting **where** to look.

Also feel free to chose a **different** parametrization style, which controls
the sort key and order by two arguments, which can be used in combination,
like:   
`list_reports -by_name` – (and plain use too) means sort by name, ascending  
`list_reports -by_name -revresed` – as before, descending  
`list_reports -by_mtime` –  means sort by modification time, ascending  
`list_reports -by_mtime -reversed` – as before, descending  
]

---
template:plain
header: ## Part 2: Processing File Content

.N.center[
The following is **not any more** based on [XILINX UG888] → *LAB 1*  
but you may well use a report generated there as test case.
]

* **In to the Editor** write a **new** subroutine:

```
proc find_in_report {fname {pattern {.*}}} {
    # ... TO BE DONE (see below)
}
```

* For the moment leave its body empty and
  * save it into a **new** file `find_in_report.tcl` and
  * be sure to remember you have to `source` **THAT** file now in Vivado

* So, **back to the Vivado Console**
  * test the modifications you made so far ...

template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Step 1: Open a File, Read Line by Line

[`open`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/open.htm
[`close`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/close.htm
[`gets`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/gets.htm
[`regexp`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/regexp.htm

* **Back to the editor** implement the following basic code structure:._[]

.N[
* with [`open`] to open the file for reading, use the argument `fname`
  as file name, store the file handle returned in a variable `fh`
* in a `while` loop (controlled by the return value of [`gets`])
  * via the file handle `fh` read the file line-by-line (using [`gets`])
  * compare each line using [`regexp`] against the regular expression
    specified as argument `pattern`
  * if it matches (i.e. [`regexp`] returns `1`)
     * print the line
* finally close the file (handle)
]

.F[:
Just in case you need a more concrete fragment:
```
set fh [open $fname r]
while {[gets $fh line] >= 0} {
    if {[regexp $pattern $line]} {
        puts $line
    }
}
close $fd
```
]

---
template:plain
header: ### Part 2 / Step 2: Optionally Make the Code More Robust

[`catch`]: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TclCmd/catch.htm

* **Back to the Vivado Console**

  * test `find_in_report` with a report and patterns of your choice

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optionally – if all is running and well and nice you still aren't tired:

* Add sufficient robustness._[] to the code by
  * [`catch`]-ing attempts to open non-existing files;
  * fixing the problem of comparison patterns
     * **not** using correct regular expressions syntax
     * starting with a minus (`-`) sign.

.F[:
If the regular expression pattern starts with a minus sign, `regexp` gets
confused because cannot discern the pattern (argument) from a (potentially
misspelled) option.  
This problem in fact is easy to fix … all you need is RTFM!  
In the case of a syntactically wrong regular expression (pattern) the cure is
to [`catch`] such problem and turn them into a nice error messages.

template: plain
header: ### Tcl Regular Expression Challenge – DIY

If to want to try the regular expressions of this challenge with more
examples of your own, you may do it with the following helper function:._[]
```
proc re_test {re} {
     while {[gets stdin line] > 0} {
         if {[regexp ^$re\$ $line]} {
              puts "matched!"
         } else {
              puts "NO match"
         }
     }
}
```

The intended use is  – say with with regular expression (3) from the list:
.pull-left[
```
re_test {-[1-9]\d*|[1-9]\d*-}
```
]
.pull-right[
(Interactively supply any test input you want and finally terminate with an
empty line.)
]

.F[:
If you strive for a bit more "concise" code you may also replace the body of the
`while`-loop with this:  
`puts [lindex [list "matched!" "NO match"] ![regexp ^$re\$ $line]] ;#`
